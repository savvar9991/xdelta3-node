# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to XDelta3. It's people like you that push the open source ecosystem forward.

## Prerequisites

- :gear: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
- :toolbox: [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)
- 🚤: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

Make sure these dependencies are installed. For zig it's version should be greater or equal to `0.13.0`.

### MacOS Specifics

When using MacOS, there are a couple of extra prerequisites that are required.

- python
- coreutils (e.g. via `brew install coreutils`)

## Getting Started

- :gear: Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- :gear: Run `npm run build:native` to build native dependencies.
- :gear: Run `npm run build:ts` to build js lib.

## Tests

To run tests:

- :test_tube: Run `yarn test:unit` for unit tests.
- :test_tube: Run `yarn test:e2e` for end-to-end tests.
- :test_tube: Run `yarn test:spec` for spec tests.
- :test_tube: Run `yarn test` to run all tests.
- :test_tube: Run `yarn check-types` to check TypeScript types.
- :test_tube: Run `yarn lint` to run the linter (ESLint).

Note that to run `test:e2e`, first ensure that the environment is correctly setup by running the `run_e2e_env.sh` script. This script requires a running docker engine.

```sh
./scripts/run_e2e_env.sh start
```

## Github Style Guide

**Branch Naming**

If you are contributing from this repository prefix the branch name with your Github username (i.e. `myusername/short-description`)

**Pull Request Naming**

Pull request titles must be:

- Adhering to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) spec
- Short and descriptive summary
- Written in imperative present tense
- Not end with a period

For example:

- feat: add lodestar prover for execution api
- fix: ignore known block in publish blinded block flow
- refactor(reqresp)!: support byte based handlers

**Pull Request Etiquette**

- Pull requests should remain as drafts when they are not ready for review by maintainers. Open pull requests signal to the maintainers that it's ready for review.
- If your pull request is no longer applicable or validated to fix an issue, close your pull request.
- If your pull request is fixable and needs additional changes or commits within a short period of time, switch your pull request into a draft until it's ready.
- Otherwise, close your pull request and [create a new issue instead.](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/new/choose)
