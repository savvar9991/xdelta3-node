## Github Style Guide

**Branch Naming**

If you are contributing from this repository prefix the branch name with your Github username (i.e. `myusername/short-description`)

**Pull Request Naming**

Pull request titles must be:

- Adhering to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) spec
- Short and descriptive summary
- Written in imperative present tense
- Not end with a period

For example:

- feat: add lodestar prover for execution api

**Pull Request Etiquette**

- Pull requests should remain as drafts when they are not ready for review by maintainers. Open pull requests signal to the maintainers that it's ready for review.
- If your pull request is no longer applicable or validated to fix an issue, close your pull request.
- If your pull request is fixable and needs additional changes or commits within a short period of time, switch your pull request into a draft until it's ready.
- Otherwise, close your pull request and [create a new issue instead.](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/new/choose)
